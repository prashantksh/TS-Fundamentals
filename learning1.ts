//  Enum is a type. These are named constants. Meaning, these are simply labels that are mapped to numbers
//  By default the first label is mapped to 0 and next to 1 and so on.
//  You can set them explicitly, but take care to ensure uniqueness.
//  You use an enum as any other data type. Observe the dot notation.
//  For example, let cat = Category.Novel;
enum Category {
  Technical, //  default value 0
  Novel,
  Poetry,
  Fiction = 5, //  explicitly set to 5
  Children //  curiously this is now 6 instead of intuitive 4
}

  pages = 345; //  Remember, everything is by default public, unless you specifically mark it as public

//  Please remember, you cannot instantiate interface by itself like a class.

//  let book = new book();      //  this is an error! interface cannot new up!

//  But you can instantiate a concrete class as of interface type provided, the class implements the interface.

let book: Book = new FictionBook(500); //  Type of the book is interface Book and not FictionBook. This is similar to C#.
